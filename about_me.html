	    <p>Third person voice aside, I'm a software developer with a background in mathematics. In my serious developer time, I like to think about how to write good, optimized code for the things I write. In my spare time, I like to think about the gym, foreign language acquisition on the mothertongue (especially if it degrades), translating/interpreting, and what to eat for maximum nutrients on minimum effort and time. </p>
